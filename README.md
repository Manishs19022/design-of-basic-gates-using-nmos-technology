NMOS is a N channel metal oxide semiconductor system. It has P type Substrate and n+  type region in the drain and source. It is used to pass strong logic zero and weak logic1.  PMOS is a P channel metal oxide semiconductor system. It has N type Substrate and p+  type region in the drain and source.

# Structure:

An NMOS transistor consists of three main regions: 
Source (S): This is the terminal through which the majority charge carriers (electrons)enter the channel. 
Drain (D): This is the terminal where the electrons flow out of the channel. 
Gate (G): The gate is the control terminal that modulates the flow of current between the
source and the drain. The gate is electrically isolated from the channel by a thin layer of
 oxide (usually silicon dioxide). 

#  NMOS INVERTER
An NMOS inverter is a basic digital logic circuit that performs the logical NOT
 operation (inversion) on an input signal. It uses a single NMOS transistor to
 achieve this functionality. In digital terms, an inverter outputs the opposite of its
 input: when the input is high (logic 1), the output will be low (logic 0), and vice
 versa.
 
# Structure     and     Working :

The structure of an NMOS inverter consists of:
 
 1.NMOS Transistor: The core component with three terminals:

 Gate (G): Input signal (A) is applied here.
 
 Drain (D): The output signal (Y) is connected here.
 
  Source (S): Connected to ground (GND).
 
 2.Pull-up Resistor (R): Connected between the output (Y) and Vdd (supply 
voltage), ensuring the output is pulled high when the NMOS transistor is off.

 3.Input Signal (A): Applied to the gate of the NMOS transistor. It controls 
whether the NMOS is on or off.
 
 4.Output Signal (Y): The output is connected to the drain of the NMOS 
transistor, providing the inverted version of the input signal.


# NMOS OR GATE:
An NMOS OR gate is a digital logic gate that performs the logical OR operation using NMOS 
transistors. In a typical OR gate, the output is high (1) if at least one of the inputs is high (1).
The NMOS OR gate uses NMOS transistors arranged in a particular configuration to achieve this 
behavior.

# Structure of NMOS OR Gate:
To construct an NMOS OR gate, two NMOS transistors are connected in parallel, as 
shown below:
 
 1.Inputs (A and B) are applied to the gates of the two NMOS transistors.
 
 2.The source of both transistors is connected to ground (GND).
 
 3.The drains of the two transistors are connected together to form the output (Y).
 
 4.A pull-up resistor is connected between the output and the positive supply voltage 
Vdd to ensure the output is pulled high when both NMOS transistors are off.

# Working of the NMOS OR Gate:
 When both inputs A and B are low (0):

  Both NMOS transistors are off because the gate-source voltage (V_GS) is below the 
threshold voltage (V_th).

  The pull-up resistor pulls the output to high (1), so Y = 1.
 
 When either A or B is high (1):
 
  If input A is high (1), the NMOS transistor connected to input A turns on, and if 
input B is low (0), the other NMOS transistor is off.
 
  The output is pulled to ground (0) through the conducting NMOS transistor, so Y =
 0.
 
 When both inputs A and B are high (1):
 
  Both NMOS transistors turn on because V_GS exceeds the threshold voltage for both
 inputs.
 
  The output is pulled to ground (0), so Y = 0

# NMOS AND GATE:  

An NMOS AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that performs the logical AND operation using 
NMOS transistors. The output of an AND gate is high (1) only when both of its inputs are high (1). 

In an NMOS-based AND gate, NMOS transistors are arranged in a series configuration. 
# Structure of NMOS AND Gate:

 1.Two NMOS Transistors: The two input signals (A and B) are applied to the gates of two 
NMOS transistors.
 
  The source of both transistors is connected to ground (GND).
 
  The drains of the two transistors are connected together to form the output (Y).
 
 2.Pull-up Resistor (R): A pull-up resistor is connected between the output node and the supply 
voltage (Vdd) to ensure the output is pulled to a high voltage when both NMOS transistors 
are off.
 
# Working of the NMOS AND Gate:
 The key idea is that NMOS transistors conduct (turn on) when the gate-source voltage (V_GS) 
exceeds the threshold voltage (V_th), creating a low-resistance path to ground. Since the transistors are connected in series, both must be on to pull the output to ground (0).

 When both inputs A and B are low (0):

  Both NMOS transistors are off because their gate-source voltages (V_GS) are below 
the threshold voltage (V_th).
 
  The pull-up resistor pulls the output to high (1).
 
  Output Y = 1.
 
 When one input is high (1) and the other is low (0):
 
  Only one NMOS transistor will be on, and the other will be off.
 
  Since the transistors are in series, the output is pulled to high (1) because there is no 
complete path to ground.
 
  Output Y = 1.
 
 When both inputs A and B are high (1):

 Both NMOS transistors are on, creating a complete path from the output to ground.

  The output is pulled to ground (0).
 
  Output Y = 0.

# CONCLUSION:
 
 In conclusion, NMOS AND, OR, and Inverter gates are fundamental building blocks in digital logic design, each serving crucial roles in basic logic operations. The NMOS inverter provides a simpleway to invert an input signal, but it requires a pull-up resistor and has limitations in driving highoutput levels, making it less efficient compared to CMOS inverters. The NMOS AND gate utilizestwo NMOS transistors in series to perform the AND operation, but its reliance on a pull-up resistor and its inability to drive high output levels make it less suitable for high-performance applications.
 
 Similarly, the NMOS OR gate, which uses two NMOS transistors in parallel, is simple and fast but suffers from the same limitations as the AND gate in terms of efficiency and output drive. While NMOS logic gates are fast and simple, they are typically less power-efficient and less versatile than CMOS logic gates, which use both NMOS and PMOS transistors.
 
 As a result, while NMOS gates are useful in specific applications requiring low complexity, CMOS technology is preferred in modern designs for its superior power efficiency, performance, and scalability.
